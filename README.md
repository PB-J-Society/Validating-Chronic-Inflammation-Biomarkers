# Validation-of-Chronic-Inflammation-Biomarkers-via-Integrated-ML-Bioinformatics-Paper
Documenting my progress towards validating and recreating a [paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12095375/#s1) titled 'Identification and validation of shared biomarkers and drug repurposing in psoriasis and Crohn’s disease: integrating bioinformatics, machine learning, and experimental approaches'.

## Paper Summary

### Research Problem
Psoriases and Crohn's Disease are two chronic inflammatory conditions that have a myriad of similarities, including shared genetic risk factors, often occuring at the same time in paitents, have overlapping immune dysregulation, and lack shared diagnoistic biomarkers and treaments. Instead of studying each disease separately, scientists wanted to find common molecular mechanisms that could better diagnoses and find existing drugs to test and treat both conditions.

### Key Findings
Li et. al (2025) identified five shared overactive genes in both disease: KIF4A, DLGAP5, NCAPG, CCNB1, and CEP55. These genes are known for controlling cell division and have been linked to immune system problems in these condiitons.  

## Main Steps
Data procurement and preprocessing

Single-cell transcriptome data

Differential expression analysis

Gene set enrichment analysis

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis

Functional enrichment analysis

Protein-protein interaction network construction and module analysis

Machine Learning

Construction of receiver-operating characteristic curves to assess diagnostic efficacy

Immune infiltration analysis

Establishment of psoriasis and CD cell models

Statistical analysis
